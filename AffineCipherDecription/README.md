### Decription

In deciphering the ciphertext, we must perform the opposite (or inverse) functions on the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext. Once again, the first step is to convert each of the ciphertext letters into their integer values. The decryption function is

D ( x ) = a^-1 ( x - b ) mod m
a^-1 : modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. i.e., it satisfies the equation
1 = a a^-1 mod m .

###### In this project a and b values are found by artificial intelligence, there is a dictionary file that helps program to find appropriate words.
